# SAPIEN: A SimulAted Part-based Interactive ENvironment
SAPIEN is a realistic and physics-rich simulated environment that hosts a
large-scale set for articulated objects. It enables various robotic vision and
interaction tasks that require detailed part-level understanding. SAPIEN is a
collaborative effort between researchers at UCSD, Stanford and SFU. The dataset
is a continuation of ShapNet and PartNet.

## SAPIEN Engine
SAPIEN Engine provides physical simulation for articulated objects. It powers
reinforcement learning and robotics with its pure Python interface.

## SAPIEN Renderer
SAPIEN Renderer renders scenes with OpenGL rasterizer and optionally Nvidia
OptiX ray-tracer. It provides visualization/realistic rendering for the SAPIEN
environment. Currently, the ray-tracing support is only available via building
from source.

## PartNet-Mobility
SAPIEN releases PartNet-Mobility dataset, which is a collection of 2K
articulated objects with motion annotations and rendernig material. The dataset
powers research for generalizable computer vision and manipulation.
